The MNIST dataset
In this assignment, you will use the MNIST dataset. It consists of a training set of 60,000 handwritten digits with corresponding labels, and a test set of 10,000 images. The images have been normalised and centred. The dataset is frequently used in machine learning research, and has become a standard benchmark for image classification models.

Your goal is to construct a neural network that classifies images of handwritten digits into one of 10 classes.
